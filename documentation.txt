/******* ESCAPE! *******\

/***What the game is?***\

    For final project in CS50 I decided to take what I learned over the semester, particularly from the last few weeks and 
Problem Set 8 and build a Javascript based game.  To implement this game I used the GMP (gogomakeplay.com) Javascript game 
engine, which is a simple, easy to learn and free Javascript game engine found online. I picked GMP after trying out several 
other Javascript engines (gameQuery, Crafty and Impact to name a few) but found them hard to understand and even harder to 
implement.  The game I created is an NES style game where the player controls a man trying to escape from prison.  The player 
uses the four directional keyboard keys and moves the man through 8 different levels, each increasing with difficulty.  The 
player has to flip switches to open gates, avoid being touched by enemies and flip more switches to activate bridges to navigate 
over holes in the floor.  The player is given 3 lives which can be lost if the player either touches an enemy or falls into a 
hole in the ground.  The player is also timed as they progress through the levels and their winning time is displayed after 
completing all of the levels.  I added the timer to give the game some sort of re-playability and allow players to compete with 
each other for the best score.  All images for my game were adapted from sprites and maps from Final Fantasy on NES, found at
www.videogamesprites.net.  Though I had to edit and rearrange the images to fit my game, I was not the individual who orginally
created the images and would like to give them credit. 

/***Setting up the Game***\

    Setting up the game is very simple once you have downloaded the .ZIP file to the CS50 appliance.  Simply unzip the files 
contents into the ~/vhosts/localhost/public folder, open up Chrome and type the IP Address in the right hand corner of the 
appliance followed by /escape (ex 192.168.154.128/escape) and the game should load.  If you happen to encounter any errors you 
may need to chmod all files in the /escape folder to 644 and all directories to 711.  Besides this I have debugged my game 
extensively and you should not encounter any problems.

/***The Controls***\

    The Controls for Escape are very simple.  The player simply uses the four directional keys on the keyboard to move the 
character up, down, left or right.  The controls also allow users to move the player diagonally by pressing two non-opposing 
keys at the same time.  This can be useful when trying to avoid enemies or when trying to get a high score, as moving diagonally 
is faster than moving in one direction.

/***Gates/Switches/Basics***\

    After mastering the controls of the game it is best to know the basics.  In this game there are 8 levels that you must complete 
before you can escape and win the game.  In each level the player must step over a switch to open up a gate to the exit ladder or 
another switch.  Each pair of switches and gates are color-coded so that you know which switch will open which gate.  When the player 
opens all of the gates in the level, the path to the exit ladder becomes clear allowing the user to progress to the next level.  
When the player climbs the ladder, the game displays a congratulatory message and prompts the user to click the screen to progress 
to the next level.  It is important to click as soon as possible if you are trying to get the best time because the timer does not 
stop for the message.  The game follows this pattern with increasing difficulty until the player reaches level 3 and enemies are added.

/***Enemies***\

    The enemies in this game are very fast and very dangerous.  Moving horizontally across the screen back and forth at twice the 
speed of our character, if the player accidentally touches and enemy, they lose a life and are re-spawned at their original starting 
point for the level. The enemies also have the ability to cross over holes in the ground without falling down into them so it is 
important to keep and eye on them at all times.  Enemies, switches and gates are the only objects the player encounters in the game 
until level 6 when holes, bridge switches and bridges are added.

/***Bridges/Holes***\

    Up until now the player has only had to worry about losing a life by touching an enemy, but in level 6 and beyond there exits 
more environmental dangers that the player has to deal with.  These new dangers are holes, which a player loses and life for if they 
accidentally fall into one.  In order to deal with holes these levels contain bridges and bridge switches.  Like the gate switches in 
previous levels, bridge switches are activated by walking over them with the character.  When the player walks over a bridge switch a 
corresponding bridge appears and allows the user to cross over the hole.  Unlike gate switches, bridge switches are not color coded and 
thus the player may activate a bridge switch thinking it is is going to turn on a bridge in one spot, but may end up having to back track 
or find another bridge switch.  

/***The End***\

    Once you have completed all 8 levels of Escape without losing all three lives, you have won the game.  Upon using the exit ladder in 
level 8 you should get a new message displayed, similar to when you progress to the next level.  This message displays the time it took you 
to complete the game and how many lives you had left upon completion.  This allows the game, although short, to be re-playable as players 
may try to beat their best time or survive with more lives left. It also allows players to compete with others and compare their best times 
along with how many lives they had left.  Although the game is simple, I think it is a great game and allows a lot of room for expansion of 
features and more levels.  Thanks for reading and enjoy!
